**SITE LINK ABOVE** 

This landing page project is intended to improve my understanding of Tailwind CSS classes.
The navigation bar will swap to a mobile widget depending on the screen size.
The site will change to dark mode automatically if the user has selected dark mode for their system preference.
In the "Let's Connect" form field the words will smoothly transition above each input field once selected.
